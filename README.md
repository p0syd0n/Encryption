# Encryption
This is ransomware.

Do not use it for bad stuff.

This ransomeware is totally for educational purpuses.

I totally dont expect anybody to use it maliciously.

I am not responsible for anything anybody does with my software.

most importantly, have fun educting yourself and your victims.

The encoder1 file uses PyAES encryption. I will soon add version 2 which uses Fernet.
